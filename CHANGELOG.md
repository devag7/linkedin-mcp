# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-14

22 tools. Reads are live-verified; the 5 write tools are hardened and gated.

### Added — tools
- `get_company_posts`, `get_company_employees` (DOM fallback, like the other
  company tools).
- `get_pending_invitations` — received + sent, partial-tolerant (returns
  whichever queue answers and reports per-direction errors).

### Changed — reads
- `get_profile` now also returns **skills, certifications, and languages**
  (sections lazy-loaded in parallel via profile components). No 30-item
  truncation — every walked entry is collected (avoids competitor #360).
- `health_check` is now a **deep** check: cookie state **plus a live Voyager
  probe** (confirms the API actually answers, not just that a cookie exists)
  **plus** today's safety-budget headroom (per-action used/cap/remaining +
  pending invites). Status is `healthy` / `degraded` / `logged_out`.

### Changed — writes (hardening; ⚠️ alpha, verify on a throwaway account)
- **No more false-positive success** (#365/#448): a new non-throwing
  `voyagerPostRaw` keeps the response body, and every write is run through a
  classifier that returns a structured status — `ok` / `duplicate` /
  `already_connected` / `restricted` / `quota_exhausted` / `not_allowed` /
  `failed` — instead of a blind `{ sent: true }`. The classifier also catches
  the two sneaky live cases proven on the burner: an **HTTP-200 body with a
  nested GraphQL `errors[]`** (how the share mutation reports failure) and a
  **plain-text error in a 200**.
- **`connect_with_person` rewired to the verified-live endpoint**: the old
  `/growth/normInvitations` path was dead. `--writecapture` recovered the exact
  call the SPA fires — `voyagerRelationshipsDashMemberRelationships?action=
  verifyQuotaAndCreateV2` with `{invitee:{inviteeUnion:{memberProfile:<urn>}}}`.
- **`create_post` rewired to the verified-live GraphQL share mutation**
  (`voyagerContentcreationDashShares`); the old `normShares` REST-li 400'd. The
  payload is byte-identical to the SPA's (confirmed by letting the SPA's own
  request through — it returns the same result). NB: brand-new/unverified
  accounts are posting-restricted; both our call and the SPA's get an HTTP-200
  GraphQL restriction error, which the classifier now reports as `failed`.
- **`react_to_post` rewired + VERIFIED LIVE** (HTTP 200 `ok`): the social-dash
  reactions GraphQL mutation (`voyagerSocialDashReactions`), `{variables:{entity:
  {reactionType},threadUrn:<activity urn>}}`. Old `/voyagerSocialDashReactions?
  threadUrn=` 400'd. Targets the post's ACTIVITY urn.
- **`comment_on_post` rewired + VERIFIED LIVE** (HTTP 201 `ok`): the social-dash
  `voyagerSocialDashNormComments` collection, `{commentary:{text,attributesV2,
  $type:TextViewModel},threadUrn:<activity urn>}`. Old `/feed/comments` 500'd.
- **`send_message` rewired + reply path VERIFIED LIVE** (HTTP 200 `ok`): the
  messenger-messages `createMessage` action (`voyagerMessagingDashMessengerMessages
  ?action=createMessage`), body `{message:{body:{text,attributes:[]},
  renderContentUnions:[],conversationUrn,originToken},mailboxUrn,trackingId,
  dedupeByClientGeneratedToken:false}`. Old `/messaging/conversations?action=
  create` was stale; this also fixes the "every reply spawns a new thread" bug
  (#483/#434) — pass `thread_id`/`conversation_urn` to reply. The NEW-thread path
  (`hostRecipientUrns`) is best-known (not yet captured).

**All 5 writes are now verified** — connect, create_post, react, comment, and
send_message (reply path live `200 ok`; new-thread `hostRecipientUrns` path
structurally verified: a live fire to a non-connection returned HTTP 422
`RECIPIENT_NOT_FIRST_DEGREE_CONNECTION`, confirming the server parsed the request
and rejected only on the connection business-rule). Every legacy REST-li write
endpoint was dead and has been replaced with the live SPA's actual request,
recovered via `--writecapture`. The classifier maps the non-connection 422 to
`not_allowed`.

### Added — tooling
- `--writeprobe`: live-fires create_post (+ react/comment on its own post) and
  prints the classified status, with self-cleanup — the burner-side verification
  loop for the writes.

### Added — tooling
- `--writecapture`: drives the authenticated burner UI to the moment each write
  fires, intercepts the outgoing Voyager POST, and `abort()`s it — recovering the
  exact path + payload the live SPA sends with **zero side effects** (no real
  post/invite/message/reaction/comment). This is how write payloads get verified
  rather than guessed.

## [2.0.0-alpha.1] - 2026-06-13

Complete rewrite of the data layer. v1 returned **zero data** in practice:
LinkedIn fronts the Voyager API with Cloudflare bot-management that rejects
stateless `fetch`/`curl` (endless 302 redirect even with a valid cookie).

### Changed — architecture
- **Stealth browser engine** ([patchright](https://github.com/Kaliiiiiiiiii-Vinyzu/patchright),
  an undetected Playwright fork) clears the Cloudflare challenge with a real
  browser fingerprint.
- **In-page Voyager fetch**: queries run inside the authenticated, challenge-passed
  page (same-origin, the exact path LinkedIn's web app uses) → structured JSON,
  not scraped DOM. Locale-independent, resilient to UI redesigns.
- One persistent browser per process; signal-handled teardown + process reap.

### Added — safety/reliability layer (130+ unit tests)
- Serial queue, human-paced jittered delays, per-action daily budgets, account
  warmup ramp, pending-invite ceiling, and a circuit breaker that hard-stops on
  any checkpoint/captcha/rate-limit (never auto-solves a challenge).

### Added — tools (live-verified)
- `get_my_profile`, `get_profile` (name, headline, summary, experience, education)
- `get_feed`, `get_notifications`, `search_jobs`, `get_inbox`, `get_conversation`
- `whoami`, `health_check`, `close_session`

### Added — CLI
- `--login` (headful interactive), `--spike` (verify), `--capture` (record live
  Voyager endpoints), plus `--status` / `--logout`.

### Removed
- v1's stateless Voyager tools (proven 0-data). OAuth path (backed no working
  tool). False README claims + the competitor comparison table.

### Notes
- Pre-release. Requires headful Chrome + a one-time `--login`. **No LinkedIn
  automation is ban-proof** — see [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md).
